        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110405/" target="_blank" title="HTML5 specification">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a> is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the <strong>content and structure of <u>web</u> content</strong> and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.<br> 
        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.</p>
    <p>
        HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items.
